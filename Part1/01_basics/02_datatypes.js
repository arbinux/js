// alert(3+3) // we are using node js , not browser

/*
note : alert() only works in the browser

alert("Hello") is part of the Browser JavaScript API (Window object).

VS Code is not a browser, so:

alert() ❌ does NOT work in VS Code terminal

alert() ❌ does NOT work in Node.js

alert() ✔️ ONLY works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.

That’s why when you type alert() in VS Code
